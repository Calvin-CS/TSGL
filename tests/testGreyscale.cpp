 * \brief Grabs the pixels from an image on the Canvas and converts them to grayscale.
 * \details
 * - Predetermine the number of threads and line thickness and store them in variables.
 * - Check if the passed parameter for the number of threads is valid:
 *    - If its a negative value, change the sign to be positive.
 *    - If its greater than 30, assign 30 to the number of threads to use.
 *    - Else, assign the passed parameter to the number of threads to use.
 *   .
 * - Set up the internal timer of the Canvas to expire every ( \b FRAME * 2 ) seconds.
 * - Store the Canvas' dimensions for ease of use.
 * - Stretch a fancy image over the Canvas.
 * - Tell the internal timer to manually sleep for a quarter of a second (to assure the draw buffer is filled).
 * - Initialize a pointer to the Canvas' screen buffer.
 * - Set up a parallel OMP block with \b threads threads.
 * - Get the actual number of spawned threads and store it in: \b nthreads.
 * - Compute the \b blocksize based on the Canvas height and \b nthreads.
 * - Compute the current thread's row based on \b blocksize and the thread's id.
 * - Generate a nice color based on the thread's id.
 * - Set a grayscale color variable to 0.
 * - For each row:
 *   - For each column:
 *     - Get the pixel color of a point of the Canvas.
 *     - Set a gray color variable to the average of the RGB components.
 *     - Draw the grayed point over the old point, and increment the index by one pixel.
 *     .
 *   - Break if the Canvas was closed.
 *   - Sleep until the Canvas is ready to render again.
 *   .
 * - Once a thread is finished grayscaling, draw a box around its rendered area using
 *   the predetermined high contrast color.
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
 * \param numberOfThreads Reference to the number of threads to use.
