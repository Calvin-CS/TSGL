 * \brief Draws a randomly generated Voronoi diagram, using OMP and private variables
 * ( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram ).
 * \details
 * - The data and methods for drawing are stored in a class.
 * - When you create an instance of the class:
 *    - The Canvas's dimensions are stored in local constants.
 *    - The number of control points are predetermined and stored a protected class instance variable.
 *    - We seed the random number generator with the time.
 *    - We allocate arrays for x and y coordinates for each of the points.
 *    - We allocate an array of k-values for each pixel on the Canvas.
 *    - For each control point:
 *      - Fill the x-coordinate and y-coordinate arrays with random values (thereby randomizing the locations
 *        of the control points).
 *      .
 *    - Seed the random number generator again with the time.
 *    - We initialize variables for the top, right, left, and bottom corner colors.
 *    - For each control point:
 *      - We get its x coordinate and y coordinate.
 *      - We determine its x-color based on a linear interpolation on the x-axis.
 *      - We determine its y-color based on a linear interpolation on the y-axis.
 *      - We determine its color based on an even mixture of its x-color and y-color.
 *      .
 *   .
 * - When you draw:
 *    - The best k-value is initially set to 0.
 *    - We initialize variables keeping track of the best and current distances.
 *    - We start a parallel OMP block, allowing the system to determine the best means of parallelization.
 *    - For each column, we set the best k to 0. Then:
 *      - For each row:
 *        - Reset the best distance to a large value.
 *        - For each control point:
 *          - We calculate the distance from row,col to the control point.
 *          - If this distance is less than the best distance, we update the best distance and best-k
 *            (best point).
 *          - We set the k-value for row,col to the best-k.
 *          - We draw a pixel at row,col with the best-k's point color.
 *          - If we closed the Canvas, break.
 *          .
 *        .

/*!
 * \brief Draws a randomly generated Voronoi diagram with fancy shading.
 * \details Same principle as voronoiFunction(). Also has a class.
 * - Key differences:
 * - We keep track of the second best distance to each point in \b nbdist.
 * - We keep track of the kvalues of each 2nd best point in the array \b kvalue2.
 * - In a second post-processing loop through the screen:
 *   - Find the closest and 2nd closest control points to each pixel.
 *   - Find the distance from the pixel to the closest control point and store it in: \b d1.
 *   - Find the distance from the closest to the 2nd closest control point and store it in: \b kd.
 *   - Set \b shading to ( \b d1 / \b kd ).
 *   - Bind \b shading between 0 and 1, and shade the pixel with \b shading.
 *   - Break if the Canvas is closed.
 *   .

 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
