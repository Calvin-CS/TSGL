/*!
 * \brief Draws the full spectrum across the x, y, and time dimensions at the given framerate
 *  and a static number of threads using OMP and takes in a command line argument for the number of threads to use.
 * \details
 * - The internal timer of the Canvas is set up to go off every \b FRAME seconds ( \b FRAME == 1 / \b FPS ).
 * - A parallel block is set up with OMP, using one thread per processor.
 * - The actual number of threads spawned is stored in: \b nthreads.
 * - Check if the argument for the number of threads is valid:
 *   - If it is less than or equal to 0, use the number of threads that we can use with OMP.
 *   - If it is greater than the number of threads that we can use, use only the number of threads that we can use with OMP.
 *   - Else, its valid and use that many threads.
 *   .
 * - While the canvas is open:
 *   - The internal timer sleeps until the next frame is ready to be drawn.
 *   - An outer for loop from 0 to 255 is set up in a per-thread striping pattern.
 *   - An inner for loop runs from 0 to the 255 normally.
 *   - Each point is drawn to the canvas, with x, y, and time representing red, green, and blue respectively.
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
 * \param numberOfThreads Reference to the number of threads to use.
