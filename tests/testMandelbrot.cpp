/*!
 * \brief Draws the Mandelbrot set on a CartesianCanvas with custom controls, a specified target update rate,
 *  and a dynamic number of threads and uses command-line arguments to specify the number of threads to use.
 *  There is also a ProgressBar that shows the progress made by each thread as the Mandelbrot set is drawn onto the CartesianCanvas.
 * \details
 * - A class containing all of the data and methods to draw a Mandelbrot set has been made.
 * - When you create a Mandelbrot object:
 *    - The number of threads to use is predetermined (passed as the \b threads parameter) and stored in: \b myThreads.
 *    - The number of iterations to check is predetermined (passed as the \b depth parameter) and stored in: \b myDepth.
 *    - The internal timer of the Canvas is set up to go off every ( \b FRAME / 2 ) seconds.
 *    - A flag telling us to redraw is set to true.
 *    .
 * - When you bind the buttons:
 *    - The spacebar on-press event is set to tell the Canvas to clear and re-render.
 *    - The left mouse on-press event is set to grab the mouse's current coordinates.
 *    - The left mouse on-release event is set to grab the mouse's current coordinates, and tell the Canvas to zoom into the
 *      bounding rectangle between the current coordinates and those from the left mouse's on press event and to redraw the Mandelbrot
 *      at that point.
 *    - The right mouse on-press event is set to grab the mouse's current coordinates, and tell the Canvas to zoom out
 *      from that area and redraw the Mandlebrot at that point.
 *    - The mouse's scroll wheel is set to tell the Canvas to zoom in / out by a predetermined amount at the mouse's
 *      current coordinates and redraw the Mandelbrot at that point.
 *    .
 * - When you actually draw the Mandelbrot object onto the CartesianCanvas:
 *   - Store the height of the Canvas, the x and y-coordinates for the ProgressBar, and the width of the ProgressBar Canvas.
 *   - Create the Canvas that will draw the ProgressBar object.
 *   - Create the ProgressBar object.
 *   - While the redraw flag is set:
 *      - Set the redraw flag to false.
 *      - Reset the internal timer to 0.
 *      - Fork off the predetermined number of parallel threads using OMP.
 *      - Store the actual number of threads spawned in: \b nthreads.
 *      - Assign a color to each thread.
 *      - Figure the cartesian size of the area each thread is to calculate and store it in: \b blocksize.
 *      - Figure out the actual number of rows each thread is to calculate and store it in: \b blockheight.
 *      - Clear the Canvas that holds the ProgressBar.
 *      - Update the ProgressBar.
 *      - Draw the ProgressBar onto the Canvas.
 *      - For 0 to \b blockheight and as long as we aren't trying to render off of the screen:
 *        - Update the ProgressBar.
 *        - Redraw the ProgressBar with labels for the ID of each thread above each segment of the ProgressBar.
 *        - Make an inner loop which determines whether to color the pixels black or a different color based off of whether they've escaped or not.
 *          - (Basic Mandelbrot calculations; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Computer_drawings ).
 *          - Break if the Canvas is to redraw.
 *        .
 *        - Handle any IO events (OS X version only).
 *        - Break if the Canvas is to redraw.
 *      .
 *      - Output the time it took to compute the screen.
 *      - While the Canvas has not been closed and it isn't time to redraw yet:
 *        - Sleep the thread for one frame until the Canvas is closed by the user or told to redraw.
 *      .
 *   .
 * - If the ProgressBar Canvas is still open, close it up.
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the CartesianCanvas being drawn to.
 * \param threads Reference to the number of threads passed via command-line arguments.
 * \param depth The number of iterations to go to in order to draw the Mandelbrot set.

/*!
 * \brief Draws a Julia set.
 * \details It is drawn in this way:
 * - It is drawn in a similar way as the Mandelbrots are.
 * - A class contains all of the necessary information to draw the Julia set.
 * - When the Julia class object is made:
 *    - Set class instance variables for keeping track of the number of threads to use,
 *      the number of iterations, point coordinates for zooming in and out, and a redraw flag
 *      that determines when we should redraw the Julia object.
 *    .
 * - When you bind buttons to the CartesianCanvas:
 *    - Bind the spacebar to clear the screen and redraw the Julia object.
 *    - Bind the left mouse button to zoom in and redraw the Julia object at the
 *      focused point.
 *    - Bind the right mouse button to zoom out and redraw the Julia object.
 *    - Bind the mouse wheel to zoom in and out when scrolled up and down (respectively)
 *      and redraw the Julia object.
 *    .
 * - When you actually draw the Julia object onto the CartesianCanvas:
 *    - Store the window width of the Canvas.
 *    - Create a VisualTaskQueue object that displays how much work each thread did in drawing
 *      the Julia object.
 *    - While its time to redraw:
 *        - Set the redraw flag to false.
 *        - Reset the Canvas' internal timer to 0.
 *        - Reset the VisualTaskQueue object.
 *        - A parallel block is made using: \b myThreads threads.
 *            - Store the thread id number and the number of threads.
 *            - Store the thread color.
 *            - An infinite loop is made where the necessary calculations needed to draw the Julia
 *              object are made and the Julia object is drawn. Once the Julia object has been drawn, the
 *              loop is broken out of. Also, if the Canvas is not open or the redraw flag is set, the loop
 *              is also broken out of. Also, if one of the threads tries to render off of the screen, the loop
 *              is broken out of. The VisualTaskQueue is also updated in this loop, and if you are a Mac user,
 *              I/O events are handled here as well.
 *              .
 *           .
 *       - Output the time it took for each iteration.
 *       - While the Canvas is open and the redraw flag is *NOT* set:
 *          - Sleep the internal timer until the next draw cycle.
 *          .
 *       .
 *    - Close the VisualTaskQueue.
