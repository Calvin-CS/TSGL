 * \brief Draws a diagonal black-to-white gradient using OMP and takes in a command-line argument for the
 * number of threads to use.
 * \details
 * - A parallel block is set up with #pragma omp parallel using the number of threads passed as a command-line argument.
 * - The outer for loop is set up in a striping pattern, and the inner for loop runs from 0 to the Canvas height.
 *   - If the Canvas is not open anymore, break out of the function.
 *   - The color ( \b color ) is set to a shade of gray based on its distance from the top left of the canvas.
 *   - The point is drawn to the Canvas.
 *   - Sleep the internal timer of the Canvas until the next draw cycle.
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
 * \param numberOfThreads Reference to the number of threads to use in the function.
