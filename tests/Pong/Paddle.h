 * \brief How can you hit a ball without a paddle?
 * \details Creates a Paddle in order to play the game, Pong.
 * \details The W and S keys move the left paddle, the Up and Down arrow keys move the right paddle in the game.
 * \details Collisions with the ball are not handled here; they are handled in the Pong class' draw() method.
 * \details The left and right paddles in the game are created from this class; they are essentially the same object.
 * However, there are side parameters in some of the methods that determine which side to place the Paddle object on and how to treat
 * the Paddle object (either as the left or the right paddle in the game). The Pong class handles how to distribute points to the Paddle objects
 * in the game (the Paddle class only has an increment() method that increments its score counter; the Pong class determines which object should
 * call that method when a point is earned).
 * \see Ball class, Pong class.
