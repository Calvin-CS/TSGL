/*!
 * \brief Draws a neat pattern of points to a Canvas using OMP and takes in a command line
 *  argument for the number of threads to use.
 * \details
 * - A parallel block is set up with #pragma omp parallel using the number of threads passed.
 * - The actual number of threads created is stored in: \b nthreads .
 * - The number of lines per thread is calculated and stored in: \b myPart .
 * - The starting position of each given thread is calculated and stored in: \b myStart .
 * - The outer for loop is set up in a block pattern, and the inner for loop runs from 0 to the Canvas width.
 *   - The color for a thread is calculated.
 *   - If the point's coordinate is even:
 *     - Draw a point on the Canvas in the thread's color.
 *   - Else:
 *     - Draw the point normally.
 *   .
 *   - The function breaks from the outer for loop if the Canvas is closed.
 *   .
 * - Sleep the internal timer of the Canvas until the next draw cycle.
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
 * \param numberOfThreads Reference to the number of threads to use.
