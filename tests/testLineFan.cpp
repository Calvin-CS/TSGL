/*!
 * \brief Draws a fan of randomly colored lines at the target framerate and a dynamic number of threads using OMP.
 * \details
 * - The internal timer of the Canvas is set up to go off every \b FRAME seconds ( \b FRAME == 1 / \b FPS ).
 * - The spacing in between the arcs of the fan is stored in the constant: \b ARC .
 * - While the canvas is open:
 *   - The number of threads to use is recalculated, and the process is forked based off of the passed number of threads: \b t.
 *   - The internal timer sleeps on each thread until the next frame is ready to be drawn.
 *   - An offset is calculated based on the thread's ID and a predefined arc-length.
 *   - An angle is then calculated using the offset and the Canvas' current lifespan ( as calculated by \b can.getReps() ).
 *   - The vertices of the lines to be drawn are chosen using the sines and cosines of the predetermined angle.
 *   - A random color is chosen.
 *   - The line is draw to the Canvas.
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
 * \param t The number of threads to use in the function.
