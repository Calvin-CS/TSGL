/*!
 * \brief Draws the area under a predefined function (the integral) using CartesianCanvas
 * and takes a command line argument for the number of threads to use.
 * \details
 * - Use the number of threads passed via command-line arguments.
 * - If that number is negative, just use one thread.
 * - Set up the internal timer of the Canvas to expire once every \b FRAME / 2 seconds .
 * - Draw axes through the origin, with spacing PI/4 between x ticks and 0.5 between y ticks.
 * - Store the width of the canvas's pixel in \b pw to avoid thousands of multiple function calls.
 * - Initialize and draw a CosineFunction using the currently rendered area of the CartesianCanvas.
 * - Set the CartesianCanvas' font from an external font file using setFont().
 * - Draw some labels on the CartesianCanvas to make things look pretty.
 * - Set up a parallel block with OMP using \b threads as the number of threads to use.
 * - Set \b nthreads to the actual number of threads spawned.
 * - Calculate each thread's share of the work and store it in: \b offset.
 * - Calculate each thread's starting position and store it in: \b start.
 * - Calculate each thread's stopping position and store it in: \b stop.
 * - For each thread, from \b start to \b stop with step size \b pw:
 *   - If the Canvas was closed, break.
 *   - Sleep the internal timer until it's ready to render.
 *   - Draw a line from x,0 to x,f(x) for the current x.
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the CartesianCanvas being drawn to.
 * \param numberOfThreads Reference to the number of threads to use.
