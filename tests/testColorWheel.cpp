/*!
 * \brief Draws a gradient color wheel using OMP with multiple threads per processor and private per-thread variables.
 * \details
 * - \b THREADS is set to a number greater than the number of physical processors.
 * - The center of the canvas is computed and stored.
 * - The radius of the wheel is computed (using the minimum of the Canvas width / height) and stored.
 * - The size of the \b GRADIENT is computed and stored.
 * - Variables for the second and third vertices of a triangle and the current shading are initialized.
 * - The internal timer of the Canvas is set up to expire every \b FRAME seconds.
 * - The predetermined number of parallel threads is forked off using OMP, pulling along the coordinate
 *   and shading variables.
 * - The actual number of threads is stored in: \b nthreads.
 * - A color \b delta is computed.
 * - Each thread's thread id ( \b tid ) is stored.
 * - Each thread's shading is computed using it's id and \b nthreads.
 * - While the Canvas is open:
 *   - The internal timer sleeps until the next frame is ready to be drawn.
 *   - Each thread's \b start is computed using the timer's lifetime and it's current id.
 *   - The second and third coordinates of a triangle approximating an arc of a circle are
 *     computed using the \b GRADIENT and the thread's \b start position.
 *   - A triangle is drawn on the Canvas for each thread, with the first vertex in the center, and
 *     the second and third vertices as computed above, with a hue based on the precomputed \b start,
 *     full saturation, and a value of \b shading.
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
