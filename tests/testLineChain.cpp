/*!
 * \brief Draws a spirograph on a given Canvas using the specified number of threads.
 * \details
 * - The number of iterations, center of the spirograph, distance between threads, and spin are stored in constants.
 * - A parallel block is made and the process is forked using the passed number of threads: \b t.
 * - The actual number of threads spawned is stored in the constant: \b NTHREADS.
 * - The rate at which the spirograph fades is calculated and stored in: \b FADERATE.
 * - The current thread's id is stored in: \b TID.
 * - \b xOld and \b yOld represent the old x and y-coordinates of the line,
 *   \b xNew and \b yNew represent the new ones.
 * - \b xNew is set to the width of the Canvas, \b yNew is set to the middle of the canvas.
 * - Set a variable, \b next, which will be used to determine the next \b xNew and \b yNew and set \b s to \b next.
 * - Get a color based off of the thread's id number.
 * - The internal timer of the Canvas is set up to go off every \b FRAME seconds ( \b FRAME == 1 / \b FPS ).
 * - While the canvas is open:
 *   - The internal timer sleeps until the next frame is ready to be drawn.
 *   - For 0 to the number of iterations per frame:
 *      - \b next is incremented by the spacing in between the threads, and \b s is incremented by the spin factor.
 *      - \b xOld and \b yOld are set to \b xNew and \b yNew.
 *      - The size of the line is determined by \b s.
 *      - \b xNew and \b yNew are calculated and set.
 *      - The line is drawn to the Canvas.
 *      .
 *   - If we are working with the main thread, draw a rectangle that is the size of the Canvas and has an alpha transparency
 *     of: \b FADERATE.
 *     .
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
 * \param t The number of threads to use in the function.
