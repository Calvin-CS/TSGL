/*!
 * \brief Simulates Newton's Cradle (or Newton's Pendulum as some call it) ( see http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/newtons-cradle-1.jpg ).
 * \details Simulates Newton's Pendulum in the following way:
 * - User variables store the sizes of each ball, the number of balls (command-line argument), and the radius of each ball.
 *   They also store the acceleration, top speed, and the amount to inverse the direction of the swing of the balls.
 * - Automatic variables store the window width and height, the center of the window, the line length, and the offset of each ball.
 * - Initial positions of the edge balls are determined.
 * - The leftmost ball is stationary; the rightmost is moving at top speed.
 * - While the Canvas has not been closed:
 *  - The Canvas' internal timer is put to sleep until the next drawing loop.
 *  - Conditionals determine the left and right ball motion.
 *  - The animation loop is paused.
 *  - The Canvas is cleared.
 *  - The stationary balls and lines are drawn first, followed by the moving balls and lines.
 *  - The animation is resumed.
 *  .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas to draw on.
 * \param numberOfBalls The number of balls to use in the function.
