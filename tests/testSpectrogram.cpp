/*!
 * \brief Displays a spectrogram.
 * \details Shows a spectrogram for the colors of a chosen photo.
 * - The window width and height are stored for ease of use.
 * - The image is drawn onto the Canvas.
 * - A Spectrogram object is created which will display the spectrogram.
 * - Sleep the Canvas for 1/10th of a second.
 * - Have a counter that keeps track of the number of pixels that we have checked (for their color).
 * - A parallel block is created and the process is forked.
 * - The thread id and the actual number of threads spawned are stored.
 * - Start and stopping points for the thread are calculated and stored.
 * - For the starting point to the ending point of rendering:
 *   - If the Canvas is open:
 *      - Sleep the internal timer until the next draw cycle.
 *      - For 0 to the width of the Canvas:
 *        - Get a hue color based off of the current pixel.
 *        - Check for a weird case where we can end up with a NaN error (Not a Number).
 *        - Draw the point onto the Canvas.
 *        .
 *      - Update the number of pixels checked in an parallel atomic block (to avoid conflicts).
 *      - Draw the results on the Spectrogram object.
 *     .
 *   .
 * - Have the Canvas sleep for: FRAME seconds.
 * - Draw the chosen image onto the Canvas.
 * - Close the Spectrogram object.
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas object to draw to.
 * \param fname The name of the file to get the image from.
