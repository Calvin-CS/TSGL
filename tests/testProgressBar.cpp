 * \brief Draws a diagonal black-to-white gradient using OMP and takes in a command line argument for the
 *  number of threads to use.
 * \details
 * - Compute and store the necessary information in order to draw the ProgressBar object
 *   (x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height, minimum, maximum, and the number of segments).
 * - Create the ProgressBar object with the information calculated in the previous step.
 * - Set the progress of drawing the ProgressBar object and store it in: \b progress.
 * - While the Canvas is open:
 *   - Sleep the Canvas' internal timer until the next draw cycle.
 *   - Increment the progress so far.
 *   - For 0 to the number of segments:
 *     - Update the ProgressBar object.
 *     .
 *   - Draw the ProgressBar onto the Canvas.
 *   .
 * .
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
