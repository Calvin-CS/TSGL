       fltk - the fast light tool kit


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a C++ graph‐
       ical user interface toolkit for the X Window System, MacOS(r), and  Mi‐
       crosoft  Windows(r)  that supports OpenGL(r).  It was originally devel‐
       oped by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a  small  group
       of developers across the world with a central repository in the US.

       FLTK  is  provides  under  the  terms of the GNU Library General Public
       License, with the following exceptions:

              1. Modifications to the FLTK  configure  script,  config  header
              file, and makefiles by themselves to support a specific platform
              do not constitute a modified or derivative work.

              The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to
              the  FLTK project - send all contributions through the "Software
              Trouble Report" on the following page:

                  http://www.fltk.org/str.php

              2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not  consti‐
              tute a derivative work.

              3.  Static  linking  of  applications  and  widgets  to the FLTK
              library does not constitute  a  derivative  work  and  does  not
              require the author to provide source code for the application or
              widget, use the shared FLTK libraries, or  link  their  applica‐
              tions or widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.

              If  you  link the application or widget to a modified version of
              FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be provided under the  terms
              of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.

              4.  You  do  not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with
              programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you have to
              identify  the  FLTK  license in your program or documentation as
              required by section 6 of the LGPL.

              However, programs must still identify their  use  of  FLTK.  The
              following  example  statement can be included in user documenta‐
              tion to satisfy this requirement:

              [program/widget] is based in  part  on  the  work  of  the  FLTK
              project (http://www.fltk.org).
