/*! \class Image
 *  \brief Draw an image to the Canvas.
 *  \details Image is a class which provides a simple interface for loading and drawing images.
 *   The Image class currently supports files in the .png, .bmp, and .jpg formats.
 *  \note For the time being, there is no way to measure the size of an image once it's loaded.
 *   Therefore, the width and height must be specified manually, and stretching may occur if the
 *   input dimensions don't match the images actual dimensions.
 *  \note Additionally, an ImageLoader must be passed as an argument. This ImageLoader is automatically
 *   constructed with the Canvas as the private *loader* variable. At the moment, there is no way to
 *   extend Canvas::drawImage() function due to this privatization.
 *  \warning Aside from an error message output to stderr, Image gives no indication if an image failed to load.
