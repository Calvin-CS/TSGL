/*! \class ConvexPolygon
 *  \brief Draw an arbitrary Convex polygon with colored vertices.
 *  \details ConvexPolygon is a class for holding vertex data for a triangle strip with colored vertices.
 *  \details Vertices are drawn in triangle strip format, where the first three vertices make up the first triangle,
 *   the next vertex plus the previous two make up the second triangle, and so on.
 *  \details This method is optimized for long lists and offers a marked improvement over drawing individual Triangle instances.
 *  \note The addVertex() method must be called the same number of times as specified in the constructor.
 *  \note Calling addVertex() after all vertices have been added will do nothing.
 *  \note Calling draw() before all vertices have been added will do nothing.
