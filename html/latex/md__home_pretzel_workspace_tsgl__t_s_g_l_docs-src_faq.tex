Q\+: A test keeps crashing with the error \char`\"{}the font file could not be opened and read
\char`\"{}! What do I do?

A\+: Are you in the bin folder of the tsgl folder? Some tests won\textquotesingle{}t work unless you are in the bin folder. Specifically\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item test\+Blur\+Image
\item test\+Calc\+Pi
\item test\+Cosine\+Integral
\item test\+Get\+Pixels
\item test\+Greyscale
\item test\+Image
\item test\+Image\+Cart
\item test\+Inverter
\item test\+Mandelbrot
\item test\+Philosophers
\item test\+Progress\+Bar
\item test\+Spectrogram
\item test\+Text
\item test\+Text\+Cart
\item test\+Text\+Two
\item test\+Units
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the test that keeps crashing is in the list above, go into the bin folder and execute it from there.
