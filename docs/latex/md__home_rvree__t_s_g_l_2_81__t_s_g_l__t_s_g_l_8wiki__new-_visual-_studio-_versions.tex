Hello!

A new Visual Studio version has come out, and the T\+S\+GL Solution must be updated.

The process is long and tedious, but this page will guide you.

Let\textquotesingle{}s begin.

1). Get the T\+S\+GL zip folder from Git\+Hub.

2). Install T\+S\+GL (using an earlier version of VS).

3). Make a clone of T\+S\+GL in a different place using Git Bash.

4). Copy over the {\ttfamily lib} and {\ttfamily include} directories from the zip file location to the cloned T\+S\+GL directory.

5). Create a new {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL directory (replacing {\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} with the Visual Studio version number).

6). Open up the new version of Visual Studio, and create a new {\ttfamily tsgl} project inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL folder. ({\ttfamily File -\/$>$ New -\/$>$ Project}, {\ttfamily Visual C++}, {\ttfamily Empty Project}, then change the name to {\ttfamily tsgl} and the {\ttfamily Location} to wherever you put the cloned T\+S\+GL folder).

You should now have a {\ttfamily tsgl} folder inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL folder.

7). Via File Manager, go into the cloned T\+S\+GL folder, and into the {\ttfamily tsgl} VS project folder. Copy over all files from the project folder (and from the {\ttfamily tsgl} folder that is inside of the {\ttfamily tsgl} VS project folder) over to the cloned T\+S\+GL folder.

You should have the solution file, and the project files for the {\ttfamily tsgl} VS project in the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace. (Plus a few extra).

8). Close V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$, and delete the {\ttfamily tsgl} folder from the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace.

9). Reopen V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$, and open up the T\+S\+GL solution file that\textquotesingle{}s in the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace. ({\ttfamily File -\/$>$ Open -\/$>$ Project/\+Solution}, then choose the solution file that is in the cloned T\+S\+GL folder).

It will say that it can\textquotesingle{}t find the {\ttfamily tsgl} project (or that it can\textquotesingle{}t load it).

You\textquotesingle{}ll have to re-\/add it back into the solution.

Remove the failed {\ttfamily tsgl} project ({\ttfamily right click on tsgl -\/$>$ Remove}).

10). Right click on {\ttfamily Solution \textquotesingle{}tsgl\textquotesingle{}}, {\ttfamily Add}, then {\ttfamily Existing Project}.

Get the {\ttfamily tsgl} project file that\textquotesingle{}s in the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace (it should say {\ttfamily tsgl} and have a {\ttfamily .vcxproj} suffix).

11). M\+A\+KE S\+U\+RE T\+H\+AT Y\+OU H\+A\+VE D\+E\+B\+UG S\+ET TO x86 OR W\+I\+N32!

12). Add the {\ttfamily .cpp} and {\ttfamily .h} files to the {\ttfamily tsgl} project.

These are a bit more tricky to add.

For starters, they have different properties than the {\ttfamily tsgl} project.

Also, they belong within the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder that we made earlier.

Some also have extra files that need to be added, like {\ttfamily test\+Langton} and {\ttfamily test\+Philosophers}.

And to top it off, there are {\itshape {\bfseries{41}}} of them. (At the time of this writing).

Which means, you\textquotesingle{}ll have to repeat this process {\itshape {\bfseries{41 times}}}.

Yes, {\itshape {\bfseries{41 times}}}.

On the bright side, we can use the {\ttfamily test\+Properties} sheet on them.

Let\textquotesingle{}s get started with {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle}.

Right-\/click on {\ttfamily Solution \textquotesingle{}tsgl\textquotesingle{}} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily Add} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily New Project}, choose {\ttfamily Visual C++}, {\ttfamily Empty Project}, and name it {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle}. Change the {\ttfamily Location} to point at the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace.

Go into the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder, and you\textquotesingle{}ll see a folder named {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle}.

Just like we did with the {\ttfamily tsgl} project, we\textquotesingle{}ll have to take out the files from this folder.

Go into the {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle} folder, copy the files over to the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} directory that\textquotesingle{}s in the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace (one directory up), and delete the {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle} folder.

Remove the {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle} project from the {\ttfamily tsgl} solution, and add the copied {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle} project that\textquotesingle{}s in the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder.

Now, add the {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle.\+cpp} file to the project. ({\ttfamily Right-\/click -\/$>$ Add -\/$>$ Existing Item}, then go to {\ttfamily src/tests} inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL folder, and add {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle.\+cpp}).

Now, click on {\ttfamily View} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily Other Windows} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily Property Manager}.

This is the place where we\textquotesingle{}ll be adding the {\ttfamily test\+Properties} sheet to the test projects.

Right-\/click on {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily Add Existing Property Sheet}, and choose the {\ttfamily test\+Properties} sheet that\textquotesingle{}s in the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace.

Click on the save icon (the one that looks like a floppy disk), and that saves the sheet for {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle}\`{}.

Go back to the {\ttfamily Solution Explorer} ({\ttfamily View} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily Solution Explorer}), and right-\/click on {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle}. Choose {\ttfamily Properties}.

Like we did for the {\ttfamily tsgl} project, we\textquotesingle{}ll have to edit the properties for each test.

Luckily, this applies to all tests. The properties are generally the same for all tests.

Here are the ones that you have to change\+:\hypertarget{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__new-_visual-_studio-_versions_autotoc_md104}{}\doxysubsubsection{General\+:}\label{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__new-_visual-_studio-_versions_autotoc_md104}

Once that is all done, {\ttfamily Right-\/click -\/$>$ Build Dependencies -\/$>$ Project Dependencies}, and check the box for {\ttfamily tsgl}.

This means that {\ttfamily test\+Alpha\+Rectangle} depends on the {\ttfamily tsgl} project and won\textquotesingle{}t build until after the {\ttfamily tsgl} project has been built.

Now, go into the {\ttfamily lib} folder inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL folder.

1). Unzip a fresh {\ttfamily T\+S\+G\+L-\/master} folder (the one downloaded from Git\+Hub).

2). Copy over the {\ttfamily win\+V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder and installer from your cloned T\+S\+GL workspace folder over to the freshly unzipped {\ttfamily T\+S\+G\+L-\/master} folder.

3). As you would normally do, run the new installer from the freshly unzipped {\ttfamily T\+S\+G\+L-\/master} folder. Hopefully, the new {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} components will be in the correct places.

Fire up the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} solution, make sure that {\ttfamily Debug} is {\ttfamily x86}, and {\ttfamily Rebuild} the solution.

Run a test, any test. They {\itshape A\+LL} should work.

If they do, then congrats! You have successfully created a new VS solution for T\+S\+GL.

Be sure to update \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/readMeWindows.txt}{\texttt{ read\+Me\+Windows.\+txt}} afterwards to include the new VS version!

{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE}}}\+: Always wait until VS says \char`\"{}\+Ready\char`\"{} at the bottom left corner when adding projects, building, etc...

{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} Delete the {\ttfamily x64} folders from the {\ttfamily Property Manager} section for {\itshape A\+LL} projects. Delete {\ttfamily .VC} files (if you can).

{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} Delete the {\ttfamily Debug} folder from the V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ folder.

{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} If you ever want to make an edit to the solution\+:

1). Move the hidden {\ttfamily .suo} file into {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} file and call it {\ttfamily tsgl.\+v$\ast$$\ast$}, replacing {\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$} with whatever toolset version you are using. (It\textquotesingle{}ll be in a hidden folder called {\ttfamily vs}, inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace folder.)

2). Take the {\ttfamily include} and {\ttfamily lib} folders from an unzipped {\ttfamily T\+S\+G\+L-\/master} folder (that\textquotesingle{}s been installed), and place them inside of the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace folder.

3). Then, move the {\ttfamily V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder, the {\ttfamily tsgl} solution and project folders, {\ttfamily tsgl.\+v$\ast$$\ast$.suo} file, and {\ttfamily test\+Properties} sheet out of the {\ttfamily win\+V\+S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} folder and into the cloned T\+S\+GL workspace.

4). Make as many edits to your heart\textquotesingle{}s content.

{\itshape {\bfseries{P\+L\+E\+A\+SE}}} update this document if you come across new links, or if there\textquotesingle{}s missing/false information.
