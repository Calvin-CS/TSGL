{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} This page is for Ubuntu/\+Debian users. If you are a Fedora/\+Red\+Hat user, please see the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}R\+PM\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page!

{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} Please make S\+U\+RE that you have {\itshape {\bfseries{at least Open\+GL 3.\+0 or greater}}} on your machine.

As of Summer 2016, an aptitude/debian package has been made for T\+S\+GL for ease of installation. Packages have been made for the following Ubuntu distros\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 14.\+04 (Trusty Tahr)
\item Ubuntu 16.\+04 (Xenial Xerus)
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you have one of those distros, you can use {\ttfamily apt-\/get} to install the T\+S\+GL library.

Follow these steps in order to get T\+S\+GL on your machine\+:

1). Type {\ttfamily sudo add-\/apt-\/repository ppa\+:tsgl-\/test/tsgl-\/dev}. When prompted, hit {\ttfamily E\+N\+T\+ER}.

2). Type {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get update}.

3). Type {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install tsgl}.

T\+S\+GL will be installed along with a packaged version of the G\+L\+FW library.

The generic {\ttfamily Makefile} for creating programs (as seen in the tutorials, i.\+e. \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Building Programs\mbox{]}\mbox{]}) is located in the {\ttfamily T\+S\+G\+L\+\_\+\+G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+I\+C\+\_\+\+M\+A\+K\+E\+F\+I\+LE} directory under {\ttfamily /usr/include/}.

Go into that directory, and copy over the {\ttfamily Makefile} into your project directory in order to start building applications that use T\+S\+GL. ~\newline
