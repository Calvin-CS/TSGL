{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} As of Summer 2016, there have been packages made for tsgl for ease of installation. Specifically, for Ubuntu and Red Hat (Fedora). As a result, if you install one of the T\+S\+GL packages, the generic {\ttfamily Makefile} will be located in {\ttfamily /usr/include/\+T\+S\+G\+L\+\_\+\+G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+I\+C\+\_\+\+M\+A\+K\+E\+F\+I\+L\+E/}. You can copy over the {\ttfamily Makefile} to your project directory and then follow the videos.
