{\bfseries{Q}}\+: What to do when Cygwin setup window crashes? ~\newline
 {\bfseries{A}}\+: Sometimes Cygwin installation window crashes unexpectedly. If that happens open the setup file and follow the \href{https://github.com/samuelth47/TSGL/blob/master/NewWindows/readmeCygwin.md}{\texttt{ steps}} again ~\newline
 ~\newline
 {\bfseries{Q}}\+: {\ttfamily source install-\/cygwin} is not working ~\newline
 {\bfseries{A}}\+: Try running {\ttfamily dos2unix install-\/cygwin} and run {\ttfamily source install-\/cygwin} again ~\newline
 ~\newline
 {\bfseries{Q}}\+: I am getting {\ttfamily wget is not installed, using lynx as fallback} error during installation ~\newline
 {\bfseries{A}}\+: You M\+U\+ST install {\ttfamily wget, lynx, and dos2unix} using the setup file of Cygwin before running the install-\/cygwin.\+sh. Launch the setup file and follow these \href{https://github.com/samuelth47/TSGL/blob/master/NewWindows/readmeCygwin.md}{\texttt{ steps}}, but this time only install {\ttfamily wget}

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: It is taking too long to install ~\newline
 {\bfseries{A}}\+: For T\+S\+GL to work on windows it needs more packages to be installed. That is why it is taking long, but it\textquotesingle{}s worth the wait \+:)

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Did you open a new terminal and run {\ttfamily startxwin}? If not, do that, and don\textquotesingle{}t stop the process nor close the terminal. ~\newline
 $<$t$>$ If you did that and it still doesn\textquotesingle{}t work, try running {\ttfamily export D\+I\+S\+P\+L\+AY\+:0.\+0} on the terminal
