G\+CC version 4.\+9 supports version 4.\+0 of Open\+MP\href{https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/gcc-49-openmp-code-cannot-be-linked-with-intel-openmp-runtime}{\texttt{ \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}}}. This makes any code compiled with O\+MP before G\+CC 4.\+9 binary uncompatable with code compiled under 4.\+9 or higher. One error cause by this is something similar to {\ttfamily Undefined \char`\"{}\+G\+O\+M\+P\+\_\+parallel\char`\"{}}.

To resolve this error, you can either downgrade your compiler to G\+CC 4.\+8 or earlier, or recompile all O\+MP code under G\+CC 4.\+9 or later.
