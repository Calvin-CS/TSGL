As of Summer 2016, we now have a Mac OS X Installer which greatly simplifies the process of installing T\+S\+GL on a Mac.

We wrapped it up in a {\ttfamily .dmg} file, which is located in the Git\+Hub repo.

You can download that file \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/MacBinInstaller/TSGL.dmg}{\texttt{ here}}.

Once you have downloaded that file, follow these instructions\+:

1). Uncompress the file, then place the {\ttfamily .dmg} file anywhere that\textquotesingle{}d you like (e.\+g. {\ttfamily $\sim$/\+Desktop/}).

2). Mount the {\ttfamily .dmg} file (double-\/click on it), and a new volume named {\ttfamily T\+S\+GL} should appear.

3). Read the {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+txt} file.

4). Open up the volume, and you should see a {\ttfamily .pkg} file named {\ttfamily Install\+T\+S\+GL}. Double-\/click on that file, follow the installation process, and T\+S\+GL should be installed on your Mac!
