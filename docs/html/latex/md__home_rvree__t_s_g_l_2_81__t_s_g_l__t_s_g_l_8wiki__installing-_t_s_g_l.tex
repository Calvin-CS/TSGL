As of summer 2016, there are two main ways that you can install T\+S\+GL\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item via a binary package {\itshape {\bfseries{(recommended)}}}.
\item directly from source.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In essence, the binary packages depend on a laundry list of dependencies.

The same is true when you install from source.

However, the three main dependencies are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.freetype.org/download.html}{\texttt{ Free\+Type}}
\item \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\texttt{ G\+L\+FW}}
\item \href{https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/glew/glew/1.12.0/glew-1.12.0.zip}{\texttt{ G\+L\+EW}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These, along with the other dependencies ({\ttfamily doxygen}, development header files, ...), are installed along with T\+S\+GL regardless of which method you choose.

When installing T\+S\+GL using a binary package on Ubuntu \& Fedora, the following is true\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian/\+Ubuntu\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Debian packages install {\ttfamily libfreetype6} and {\ttfamily libfreetype6-\/dev}. This resolves the Free\+Type dependency.
\item The Debian packages install {\ttfamily libglew-\/dev}. This resolves the G\+L\+EW dependency.
\item A packaged version of the {\ttfamily G\+L\+FW} library is installed along with the T\+S\+GL Debian packages. This resolves the G\+L\+FW dependency.
\item Please be sure to have {\itshape {\bfseries{at least Open\+GL 3.\+0 or greater}}} on your machine. You can update your graphics drivers by typing the following command\+: {\ttfamily sudo ubuntu-\/drivers autoinstall}. If that does not work, there are plenty of online tutorials which should help you.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fedora/\+R\+PM\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The R\+PM package installs {\ttfamily freetype} and {\ttfamily freetype-\/devel}. This resolves the Free\+Type dependency.
\item The R\+PM package installs {\ttfamily glew} and {\ttfamily glew-\/devel}. This resolves the G\+L\+EW dependency.
\item A packaged version of the {\ttfamily G\+L\+FW} library (named {\ttfamily glfw\+T\+S\+GL}) is also installed along with T\+S\+GL. This resolves the G\+L\+FW dependency.
\item As with the Debian packages, please be sure to have {\itshape {\bfseries{at least Open\+GL 3.\+0 or greater}}} on your machine!
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item Linux
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu\+: \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh}{\texttt{ install-\/ubuntu.\+sh}}
