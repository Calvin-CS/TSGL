{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}}} This document attempts to guide you in the process of Debian package creation. Given that, package creation can be a long and complex process. If there\textquotesingle{}s something that we missed, or perhaps have misleading information, please edit this page accordingly!

Hello!

So, you need to make a new Debian package for T\+S\+GL.

Package creation isn\textquotesingle{}t trivial, and has a steep learning curve.

What\textquotesingle{}s more, we think that creating a Debian package is a {\itshape {\bfseries{L\+OT}}} more complex than creating an R\+PM package.

The reason? Instead of having to keep track of one file (S\+P\+EC file), you have to keep track of multiple.

Luckily, this document will attempt to guide you through the process.

Let\textquotesingle{}s get started with a brief intro to Debian packages.

\DoxyHorRuler{0}
 \hypertarget{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__creating-_new-_deb-_packages_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{$\vert$ Creating Debian packages\+: intro $\vert$}\label{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__creating-_new-_deb-_packages_autotoc_md31}
Before we can even begin to talk about how to build a Debian package, we need to know what\textquotesingle{}s inside one.

So, what exactly is inside of a Debian package?

Magic? Close.

There are three components to a Debian package\+: ~\newline


1). Upstream tarball -\/ the original source code for the library/application. This comes from developers \char`\"{}upstream\char`\"{}, which means that they are the original authors of the code.

2). Source package -\/ has all of the necessary files needed to compile/build the software. Includes\+: the upstream tarball with {\ttfamily .tar.\+gz} ending, a description file ({\ttfamily .dsc}), and a tarball with any changes made to the upstream source code and all files created for the Debian package (usually has a {\ttfamily .debian.\+tar.\+gz} or {\ttfamily .diff.\+gz} ending).

3). Binary packages -\/ what actually get installed on a user\textquotesingle{}s system.

You usually have to get the upstream tarball from some developers who are working on a piece of software. (You type {\ttfamily apt-\/get source $<$package-\/name$>$} in order to fetch it). ~\newline


In this case, however, the upstream tarball will be created by you.

Therefore, there is no need to get an upstream tarball. You\textquotesingle{}ll create one yourself!

Follow these steps\+:

1). Create a new folder and call it {\ttfamily tsgl-\/$<$version-\/number$>$}, replacing {\ttfamily $<$version-\/number$>$} with whatever version T\+S\+GL is currently.

(If you\textquotesingle{}ve made minor changes, like new features or improvements, bump up the middle number by 1.

e.\+g. 1.\+1.\+1 -\/$>$ 1.\+2.\+1.

If you\textquotesingle{}ve added a bug fix, bump up the third number by one (or add 1 if there is no third number).

e.\+g. 1.\+3 -\/$>$ 1.\+3.\+1 OR 1.\+1.\+1 -\/$>$ 1.\+1.\+2

If you\textquotesingle{}ve made only improvements to the documentation, make no changes to the version number.)

2). Go to wherever you have the T\+S\+GL folder (which you can get using git if you don\textquotesingle{}t have it; {\ttfamily git clone \href{https://www.github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL.git}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+github.\+com/\+Calvin-\/\+C\+S/\+T\+S\+G\+L.\+git}}}).

3). Take {\itshape A\+LL} of the files in the T\+S\+GL folder, and copy them over to the {\ttfamily tsgl-\/$<$version-\/number$>$} folder.

Okay, now we\textquotesingle{}ll create the actual upstream tarball.

1). Open up a terminal, and go to the place where the {\ttfamily tsgl-\/$<$version-\/number$>$} folder is located.

2). Type\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar czvf tsgl-\/<version-\/number>.tar.gz tsgl-\/<version-\/number>}
\end{DoxyCode}


3). Type {\ttfamily ls}, and you should see files that look like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tsgl-\/<version-\/number>.tar.gz tsgl-\/<version-\/number> }
\end{DoxyCode}


Congrats! You created the upstream tarball, and have taken your first step in making a Debian package. ~\newline


Now, let\textquotesingle{}s take a closer look at the intricacies of debian package creation.

\DoxyHorRuler{0}
 \hypertarget{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__creating-_new-_deb-_packages_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{$\vert$ Creating Debian packages\+: files, files, and more files $\vert$}\label{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__creating-_new-_deb-_packages_autotoc_md33}
Now that you have the upstream tarball created, it\textquotesingle{}s time to get into the nitty gritty details of Debian packaging.

We\textquotesingle{}ll go into preparing the library so that it can be packaged up.

You know how you have to prepare a turkey before actually cooking it?

The process is somewhat similar when creating a Debian package. ~\newline


Go into the {\ttfamily tsgl-\/$<$version-\/number$>$} folder after creating the upstream tarball. Create a folder named {\ttfamily debian}.

This one folder, {\ttfamily debian}, will store all of the necessary files needed in order to create a Debian package.

And quite a lot of files we need....


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily changelog}
\item {\ttfamily control}
\item {\ttfamily rules}
\item {\ttfamily compat}
\item {\ttfamily tsgl.\+install}
\item {\ttfamily copyright}
\item {\ttfamily source/format}
\item {\ttfamily postinst}
\end{DoxyItemize}

There are more, but these will suffice.

You\textquotesingle{}re going to have to create each and every one of these files.

Like we said, a bit more complicated than R\+PM package creation.

Let\textquotesingle{}s get started with the {\ttfamily changelog} file.

\DoxyHorRuler{0}
 \hypertarget{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__creating-_new-_deb-_packages_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{$\vert$ $<$tt$>$changelog$<$/tt$>$ file $\vert$}\label{md__home_rvree__t_s_g_l_2_81__t_s_g_l__t_s_g_l_8wiki__creating-_new-_deb-_packages_autotoc_md35}
This file essentially explains what has been changed in the Debian package. Ranging from a minor change to the {\ttfamily control} file (explained shortly), or a full scale rework of the entire package, you have to explain what you changed in this file.

Don\textquotesingle{}t worry, you don\textquotesingle{}t have to explain {\itshape {\bfseries{E\+V\+E\+RY}}} little detail. You only have to summarize your changes.

This file is also {\itshape {\bfseries{E\+X\+T\+R\+E\+M\+E\+LY}}} picky in regards to format. There is a specific format for this file that {\itshape M\+U\+ST} be followed.

Since you\textquotesingle{}re creating a brand new package, we assume that the only thing that has been changed is the T\+S\+GL source code. ~\newline


To create the {\ttfamily changelog} file, be in the {\ttfamily tsgl-\/$<$version-\/number$>$} directory, and type this command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{dch -\/-\/create -\/v <version-\/number> -\/-\/package tsgl}
\end{DoxyCode}


(If {\ttfamily dch} isn\textquotesingle{}t installed, type {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install devscripts} and repeat this step).

You\textquotesingle{}ll be asked to pick an editor. Pick whichever one is the easiest one to use.

Now, you should see something like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tsgl (<version-\/number>-\/<debnumber>) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  * Initial release. (Closes: \#XXXXXX)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{ -\/-\/ kodemonkey <kodemonkey@kodemonkey-\/desktop>  Mon, 06 Jun 2016 15:56:57 -\/0400}
\end{DoxyCode}


Let\textquotesingle{}s break it down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily tsgl ($<$version-\/number$>$-\/$<$debnumber$>$)} specifies the name of the package and the current version number. The {\ttfamily $<$debnumber$>$} tells us what version is the D\+E\+B\+I\+AN package. You can create multiple versions of the same package, without changing the source code of the package software. Usually this is when a new dependency needs to be added, or a new file needs to be added to the {\ttfamily debian} folder. In this case, since we are creating it, set this number to 1.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If this were an already created package, and we didn\textquotesingle{}t make any changes to the T\+S\+GL source code, but made changes to the {\ttfamily debian} files, we would have to add 1 to the {\ttfamily $<$debnumber$>$}

E.\+g. tsgl (1.\+1.\+2-\/1) -\/$>$ tsgl (1.\+1.\+2-\/$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$2$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily U\+N\+R\+E\+L\+E\+A\+S\+ED} specifies the Linux distro that we developed the library for.
\end{DoxyItemize}
