G\+C\+C version 4.\+9 supports version 4.\+0 of Open\+M\+P\href{https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/gcc-49-openmp-code-cannot-be-linked-with-intel-openmp-runtime}{\tt \textbackslash{}\mbox{[}1\textbackslash{}\mbox{]}}. This makes any code compiled with O\+M\+P before G\+C\+C 4.\+9 binary uncompatable with code compiled under 4.\+9 or higher. One error cause by this is something similar to {\ttfamily Undefined \char`\"{}\+G\+O\+M\+P\+\_\+parallel\char`\"{}}.

To resolve this error, you can either downgrade your compiler to G\+C\+C 4.\+8 or earlier, or recompile all O\+M\+P code under G\+C\+C 4.\+9 or later.
